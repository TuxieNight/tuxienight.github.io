<h1>Physics Lens Simulator</h1>
I was taking a physics and a computer graphics course at the same time, so I decided to combine my knowledge from both to create a visualization of something I learned in my physics class. The <a href="http://tuxienight.github.io">webpage</a> itself will explain how the visualization works.
